```

Default URL: `http://localhost:57374`

## Design

The dashboard uses a dark theme inspired by Vercel and Linear:

- Dark background (`#0a0a0b`) with subtle borders (`#1a1a2e`)
- Purple accent color (`#7c3aed`) for active states and highlights
- Sidebar navigation on the left for all views
- Overview cards at the top showing session state, phase, iteration count, and agent status
- Responsive layout that works on desktop and tablet screens

## Dashboard Views

### Overview

Top-level overview with status cards:

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Session Status | Running, paused, stopped with color indicator |
| Current Phase | Active SDLC phase |
| Iteration | Current iteration number |
| Agents | Active agent count |

### Task Queue

Visual task management:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pending | Tasks waiting to execute |
| In Progress | Active tasks |
| Done | Completed tasks |

### Logs

Real-time log streaming with filtering options.

### Memory / Learnings

Browse cross-project learnings:

- Filter by type (patterns, mistakes, successes)
- Search learnings
- View statistics

### Completion Council

Council monitoring with four tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Overview** | Current council state, enabled status, vote counts |
| **Decision Log** | History of council verdicts (continue vs. complete) |
| **Convergence** | Git diff hash tracking chart showing progress stagnation |
| **Agents** | Active agent list with pause/resume/kill controls |

The council uses a 3-member voting system with 2/3 majority required for completion decisions. When all members vote unanimously, an anti-sycophancy devil's advocate review is triggered to confirm the decision.

## API Integration

The dashboard uses the HTTP API at port 9898 for data:

```javascript
// Dashboard fetches from API
const status = await fetch('http://localhost:9898/status').then(r => r.json());
const logs = await fetch('http://localhost:9898/logs?lines=100').then(r => r.json());
```

SSE for real-time updates:
```javascript
const events = new EventSource('http://localhost:9898/events');
events.onmessage = (e) => updateUI(JSON.parse(e.data));
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Start

```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :57374

# Kill existing process
lsof -i :57374 | awk 'NR>1 {print $2}' | xargs kill

# Use different port
loki dashboard start --port 8080
```

### Dashboard Shows No Data

```bash
# Verify API server is running
loki api status

# Start API server
loki serve

# Check status endpoint
curl http://localhost:9898/status
```

### Connection Refused

```bash
# Check dashboard status
loki dashboard status

# Restart dashboard
loki dashboard stop
loki dashboard start
```
